# Computational Sills For Biological Data

## EEOB/BCB 546X - Fall 2018 - Iowa State University

With the advent of big data across a number of sub-disciplines within biology, there is an increasing need for biologists to be comfortable and
competent with command-line data processing and analysis. This course will develop basic skills necessary for biologists working with big data sets.
Topics will include UNIX commands, scripting in R and Python, version control using Git and GitHub, use of high performance computing clusters, and writing effective data-management plans. These topics
will be taught using a combination of lectures and computational exercises.
