# EEOB/BCB 546X Installation Guide

## Unix

In order to complete computational exercises and the group project for this course, students will need access to a Unix operating system, which is the core for Mac OS X and Linux operating systems.

### Windows Users

A Unix environment can be emulated using the “​Git Bash​” program, by partitioning your hard drive and installing Ubuntu (a free version of Linux),​ or by installing Cygwin​. These solutions for PC users may not be ideal for all course exercises and we can provide access to Mac computers if you would prefer to go this route.

* Ubuntu: [​https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi)
* Cygwin: ​[https://www.cygwin.com](https://www.cygwin.com)

## Slack

All course communication will be conducted via slack. You should have gotten an invitation to join the course slack team called **BioDataSkills** (if not, please contact one of the instructors). Please be sure to check slack regularly for course updates. It is recommended that you download the Slack desktop app ([https://slack.com/downloads](https://slack.com/downloads)), which makes it easier to stay on top of messages.
