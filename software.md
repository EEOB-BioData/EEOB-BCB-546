# EEOB/BCB 546X Software Guide

## Unix

In order to complete computational exercises and the group project for this course, students will need access to a Unix operating system, which is the core for Mac OS X and Linux operating systems.

### Windows Users

A Unix environment can be emulated using the “​Git Bash​” program, by partitioning your hard drive and installing Ubuntu (a free version of Linux),​ or by installing Cygwin​. These solutions for PC users may not be ideal for all course exercises and we can provide access to Mac computers if you would prefer to go this route.

* Git Bash: ​[https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash](https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash) 
* Ubuntu: [​https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wubi)
* Cygwin: ​[https://www.cygwin.com](https://www.cygwin.com)

## HPC-Class

Much of the work you will do for this class will be executed on the course cluster. To log on to this resource, you need to be on campus or use the ISU VPN. To set up the VPN, follow the instructions on the [ISU HPC site](https://www.hpc.iastate.edu/guides/classroom-hpc-cluster/access-and-login).

To get to your account on the cluster, open your terminal (Unix) or Git-Bash (Windows) and type the following in the command line, but be sure to replace `your_ISU_NETID` with your actual ISU NETID:

```bash
ssh your_ISU_NETID@hpc-class.its.iastate.edu
```

After you execute this command, you will be prompted to input your ISU NETID password. IF you enter the correct password, you will then be in your home directory on the remote machine.

## Text Editors 

We highly recommend that you use an advanced text editor for this course and your research. Here are some that we like:

* vim or emacs (Unix, Mac OS X)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (Unix, Mac OS X, Windows)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Unix, Mac OS X, Windows)
* [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (Mac OS X)

## Slack

All course communication will be conducted via slack. You should have gotten an invitation to join the course slack team called **BioDataSkills** (if not, please contact one of the instructors). Please be sure to check slack regularly for course updates. It is recommended that you download the Slack desktop app ([https://slack.com/downloads](https://slack.com/downloads)), which makes it easier to stay on top of messages.
