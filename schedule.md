## Accessing Data and Class Files

All of the files used for in-class activities and assignments are published online in a public GitHub repository. It is expected that you will pull any new changes to this repository at the beginning of class. This will enable you to access new data files and scripts needed for in-class activities.

The Spring 2021 repository can be found at: [https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/BCB546-Spring2021](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/BCB546-Spring2021).

You will also need to access the files associated with the course textbook _Bioinformatics Data Skills_ by Vince Buffalo. This repostitory can be found here: [https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files).
