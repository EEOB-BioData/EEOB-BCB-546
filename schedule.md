We will update this page before every class with the slides and links to in-class materials. To view the planned schedule of course activities, view the class calendar using the button below.

## Accessing Data and Class Files

All of the files used for in-class activities and assignments are published online in a public GitHub repository. It is expected that you will pull any new changes to this repository at the beginning of class. This will enable you to access new data files and scripts needed for in-class activities. 

The 2018 repository can be found at: [https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/BCB546X-Fall2018](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/BCB546X-Fall2018).
