# Unix Exercise and Tutorials:

--

* In the `Week_01` folder of the GitHub repository, I have placed a UNIX exercise and instructions for how to log in and complete this on hpc-class

--

* I would start working through this this weekend, and I will be available to help with questions during open lab on Monday.

--

* If you would like additional, basic tutorials on UNIX some online resources include:


https://sites.google.com/site/eeob563/computer-labs/lab-1

http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/Unix_and_Perl/

--

* And before going further: Any ideas how and when UNIX can be useful?

---

# And now for something new...

---

## Standard Out and Standard Error

--

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/streams.png" alt="scream" style="width: 600px;" /></div>

--

* What is the difference between standard output and standard error?

--

* Within the `Week_01` folder you have several examples files; once inside the folder try this:

```
$ cat file1 file2 file3
```

--

* In the output, what is standard out and what is standard error?

---

## Standard Out and Standard Error

--

* How can standard output and standard error be redirected?

--

```
$ cat file1 file2 file3 > data 2> error
```

--

* How can standard out be appended to an existing file?

--

```
$ cat file4 file5 >> data
```

---

## Creating and navigating through directories:

--

* Let's set up a project as in Buffalo Chapter 3:

--

```
$ mkdir zmays-snps
$ cd zmays-snps
$ mkdir data
$ mkdir data/seqs scripts analysis
```

--

* Try this in your course folder and use the `ls` and `cd` commands to make sure you understand what is happening with the last line of code

--

* From within the `seqs` folder, how might you navigate to the `zmays-snps` folder in one line of code?
---

## The `rm` command and why nerds use underscores in their folder/file names:

--

* Let's create a folder in `zmays-snps` with a space in its name: `raw sequences`

--

```
mkdir raw\ sequences
```

--

* Now in `zmays-snps` let's create two more folders:

```
$ mkdir raw sequences
```

--

* Over the next few weeks we pile data into `raw` and `sequences` and then one night when we're under-caffeinated we decide to remove the `raw sequences` folder:

```
$ rm -rf raw sequences
```

--

* What just happened?
<div style="text-align:left"><img src="images/scream.png" alt="scream" style="width: 60px;" /></div>

--

* How *should* we have removed the `raw sequences` folder?

---


## Using shell expansion to make your life easier:

--

* Let's go ahead and delete the nice `zmays-snps` directory we've created:

```
$ rm -rf zmays-snps
```
--

* Note that this folder and *all its subdirectories* are erased...thank you `-rf` option

--

* Now let's try creating the entire project directory in a single line of code:

--

```
$ mkdir -p zmays-snps/{data/seqs,scripts,analysis}
```
--

* Explain exactly what's going on here...

--

* Note the use of the `-p` option for the `mkdir` command which allows for creation of intermediate directories as required

--

* Let's use shell expansion to create some files in our reconstructed project directory:

--

```
$ cd zmays-snps/data
$ touch seqs/zmays{A,B,C}_R{1,2}.fastq
```
---

## Wildcards can make your life easier too!

* Navigate into your `seqs` folder and use the `ls` command in combination with the `*` and `?` wildcards to match subsets of the files we just created

--

* How do `*` and `?` match differently?

--

* Let's create new `R1` and `R2` folders and use a wildcard range to move only the "A" and "B" files into these new folders:

--

```
$ mv zmays[AB]_R1* R1
$ mv zmays[AB]_R2* R2
```

--

* Convince yourself only the appropriate files have been moved and then move the "C" files as well

--

* Always be careful with wildcards, particularly when using the `rm` command.  For example:

--

How are these different?

```
$ rm -rf tmp-data/aligned-reads*

$ rm -rf tmp-data/aligned-reads *
```

---

##The Pipe

--

* In this example, how are standard out and standard error streams being funneled?

```
$ cat file1 file2 | grep "AGGATA" | wc
```

--

* Why pipe rather than create intermediate files?

--

* Behold the mighty `grep` command!!

--

* Let's see what this command can do using an example from Buffalo Chapter 3...

--

*  First, we need to clone supplementary material for the book into hpc-class so `cd` to the top of your directory and type:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files
```

---

Suppose we're working with a program that throws an error telling us that our fasta input file has non-nucleotide characters.  Let's use grep in a pipe to inspect our input file:

```
$ grep -v "^>" tb1.fasta | grep --color -i "[^ATGC]"
```

---

## Controlling streams within pipes

--

* Pipes can string together multiple programs and increase the efficiency of our analysis

--

* However, imagine your pipe includes 20 programs and multiple errors are thrown to your display during the analysis

--

* Which program had the issue printed to standard error?

--

* Let's talk through an example of how to manage this:

--

```
$ program1 input.txt 2> program1.stderr | \ 
	program2 2> program2.stderr > results.txt
```

--

* But what if we want to send our standard output and standard error to the same place?

--

```
$ program1 input.txt 2>&1 | grep "error"
```

---

## But what if I really love intermediate files?

--

* Sometimes you or your collaborator may need intermediate files in a pipeline for other analyses or for debugging

--

* Can you retain the efficiency of the pipe while also creating intermediate files?

--

* You betcha:

--

```
$ program1 input.txt | tee intermediate-file.txt | program2 > results.txt
```

---

##Managing processes: sending programs to the background:

--

* Often times our UNIX programs and pipelines will run for an extended amount of time

--

* It is not terribly convenient to sit and stare at our terminal for weeks at a time

--

* The running job also ties up our terminal if we're running it in the foreground (however, you can open up multiple tabs or terminals)

--

* One solution to this is running your analysis in the background using the ampersand:

--

```
$ program1 input.txt > results.txt &
```

--

* This process will be run in the background, freeing up your terminal, and a process ID will be provided:

--

```
[1] 25744
```

---

##Managing processes: checking status and bringing to the foreground:

--

* Say the next day we come to work and want to check quickly whether our analysis is still running:

--

```
$ jobs
[1]+ 	Running 	program1 input.txt > results.txt
```

--

* And what if, now that we're back at work, we want to stare at the process while it runs all day?

--

*  This is where your process ID number will come in handy:

--

```
$ fg %25744
```

--

* Now you can watch your process run to your heart's content

--

* Question: *What happens when you run a program in the background and close your terminal application?*

---

##Managing processes: sending active programs to the background: 

--

* Say you start a program, realize it's going to take forever to run and then want to send it to the background...

--

```
$ program1 input.txt > results.txt
$ # enter control-z here...NOT CONTROL-C!!
[1]+ Stopped 	program1 input.txt > results.txt
$ bg
[1]+ program1 input.txt > results.txt
```

--

* To irrevocably kill a job type "control-c"; your job must be in the foreground for this to work

---

##Checking the exit status of a completed program

* Say we come into work and find our program has completed with no errors printed to our display

--

* To double-check that all has gone swimmingly, we can check the exit status by inspecting our shell variable:

--

```
$ grep -v "^>" tb1.fasta | grep --color -i "[^ATGC]"
CCCCAAAGACGGACCAATCCAGCAGCTTCTACTGCTAYCCATGCTCCCCTCCCTTCGCCGCCGCCGACGC
$ echo $?
0
```

--

* You can utilize the exit status in your pipelines by implementing the shell operators `&&` and `||`

--

* A few examples:

--

```
$ program1 input.txt > intermediate-results.txt && \
	program2 intermediate-results.txt > results.txt
```

--

```
$ program1 input.txt > intermediate-results.txt || \
	echo "warning: an error occurred"
```

---

##Exit status operators, `true` and `false`

--

* There are two Unix commands that are very useful for understanding exit status, the shell variable and operators: `true` and `false`

--

* `true` always sets the shell variable to 0 (success)

--

* `false` always sets the shell variable to 1 (failure)

--

* Try the following commands and see if what they return makes sense to you:

```
$ true && echo "first command was a success"
$ true || echo "first command was not a success"
$ false || echo "first command was not a success"
$ false && echo "first command was a success"
```
---

## Command substitution:

--

* Sometimes rather than piping, we may actually want to nest commands within other commands

--

* This process is called "command substitution" and here are a few examples...

--

* `cd` into the `chapter-03-remedial-unix` folder of your Buffalo online materials and in your terminal type:

```
$ echo "There are $(grep -cv '^>' tb1.fasta) lines of sequence in my FASTA file."
```
--

* What is the result, and what's going on here?

--

* Now `cd` into your `in_class` folder and try:

--

```
$ mkdir results-$(date +%F)
$ ls
```

--

* You can name folders and files with today's date without even knowing what that is!
