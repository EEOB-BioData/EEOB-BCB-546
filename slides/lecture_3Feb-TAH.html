# Introduction to Version Control using Git

???

Notes for the _first_ slide!

# Accessing Remote Machines

## Streamline remote access: Authentication with a SSH key

Passwords are not always secure and can be annoying to type.

--

* SSH keys are much more secure and allow you to log in without typing your password 
(or just a different, simpler passphrase).

--

* When you generate a key, you create two things: a public key and a private key. 

--

* You place the public key on any server and then unlock it by connecting to it with a client that already has the private key. 

--

* When the two match up, the system unlocks without the need for a password. We can see how to do this on `hpc-class`.

--

* SSH keys are also very important for using Git with remote hosts (e.g., GitHub)

---


# Authentication with a SSH key

Log in to `hpc-class`

```
ssh <ISU NetID>@hpc-class.its.iastate.edu
```

--

Create the key pair in your home directory:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
--

Once the `ssh-keygen` command has been issued, you will be asked a few questions:

--

```
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/phylo/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

You can just hit _enter_ here and it should save it to the file path given.

--

```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```

Here is where you decide if you want to password-protect your key. The downside, 
to having a passphrase, is then having to type it in each time you use the Key Pair. 

---

# Authentication with a SSH key

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/phylo/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/phylo/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/phylo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
4a:dd:0a:c6:35:4e:3f:ed:27:38:8c:74:44:4d:93:67 phylo@Arrow
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|          .oo.   |
|         .  o.E  |
|        + .  o   |
|     . = = .     |
|      = S = .    |
|     o + = +     |
|      . o + o .  |
|           . o   |
|                 |
+-----------------+
```

---

# Authentication with a SSH key

You now have a file called `id_rsa.pub` in your `.ssh` folder.

```
cat id_rsa.pub
```

```
[phylo@hpc-class ~]$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub 
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC8QgicqcpFPeyYZhJFW5lBTAdAjHBaYzLwH3l7+lrdmpEKMMMhXMZV5ucxN5WzWU/ERYviYQvQ8NBzkSuHo+SgNJkufF92UqeHIfI/KqgVEGbQn6NGfa5WFBgWZAJAjMzUUrAhJ2qsBez4M1f70os1S2SNcNfoFAJRdWEGE8SX2lpww8+VdCOY6ONw3AYbZbrZtn/ua2hJg+XjYb3T04ggV6TNyV4nnN5r2pRIjJA5OBX1TWcB9HOE4ZIGZoZlk5OYuUJ5rOfuzVLqanWayB3ujuPxW3IUmI6XJt7uDc1N5iVNs2FusjSZmuggWtzCw/pb7EExvNxYMYOxCsewjE0L phylo@hpc-class.its.iastate.edu
```

# Tracking Your Science

### With a version control system (and LaTeX), the file history looks a lot different.

* Example: A grant proposal involving 4 contributors:

--

```
 18537 Aug  1 2016 aim-models.tex
 13341 Aug  1 2016 aim-plants.tex
 16758 Aug  1 2016 aim-tests.tex
 17750 Aug  1 2016 background.tex
 11421 Aug  1 2016 prior-etc.tex
374875 Aug  1 2016 main.pdf
  1269 Jul 28 2016 approach.tex
  5049 Jul 28 2016 broader.tex
 13356 Jul 28 2016 budget.tex
  7548 Jul 28 2016 data.tex

# Version Control Systems

## What options are there for versioning projects?

--

* The most common in biology are Git (and historically SVN and CVS).

* There are [many others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_version_control_software)

---

# Version Control Systems

## What do they allow you to do?

--

* Track changes made to each file

--

* Revert the entire project or a single file to a previous version

--

* Review changes made over time

--

* View who modified the file (and `blame` them for something if necessary)

--

* Collaborate with others without overwriting their work or risk file corruption, etc.

--

* Have multiple independent **_branches_** of the same repository and make changes without
effecting others' work.

--

* And more...

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## Git manages a filesystem as a set of snapshots 

Snapshots are called _commits_

## Remote Git repository hosting services

### There are several options for remote hosts

--

* You can set up your own server and host all of your repositories privately using [Gitolite](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/) or [Gitosis](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/gitosis) (not recommended)

--

* You can use a web-based Git host

---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## Remote Git repository hosting services

### [Web-based Git hosts](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-hosting-services-compared/)

--

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png" alt="Drawing" width="35" />: free public repositories & paid private repositories (private repos are [free for academics](https://education.github.com/students)), with repositories over 1 GB discouraged and file size limited to 100 MB

--

* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) <img src="http://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/512/37/37104.png" alt="Drawing" width="25" />: unlimited free public & free private repositories, limited at 1-2 GB/repo (register with your *.edu* email to get unlimited collaborators on private repositories) 
--

* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) <img src="https://maxcdn.icons8.com/Share/icon/color/Logos//gitlab1600.png" alt="Drawing" width="25" />: unlimited free public & free private repositories with no limits on collaborators, but limited at 10 GB/repo

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## Despite the &#x2665;, Git does have some limitations

Most relevant to this course and our fields are:

* **_Repository size_**: If your repository gets very large, working within it can be a problem.
The network speed will be the main bottleneck. This is why the online Git hosts discourage repos
over 1-2 GB. 

* **_File size_**: A single large file can be problematic, particularly if it is frequently being
modified. This can also lead to swollen repositories. GitHub will not allow any file over 100 MB.

* **_File type_**: Git works best with text files, you can have binary files in your 
repository, but you lose some functionality of version control (like `diff`). Binary files
are also often very large. Thus, it is 
recommended that you keep binary files to a minimum. (This means that it is not practical
to use Git to collaborate on MS Word documents.)

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## Demo: Clone a Repository

You become familiar with the concepts by using Git. We will start by cloning [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/).

ggplot2 is an R package that provides a rich and powerful set of tools for data visualization ([H. Wickham. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis. Springer-Verlag New York, 2016](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/authors.html)). 

--

Start by going to [https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) to get the URL.

--

```
$git clone git@github.com:tidyverse/ggplot2.git
Cloning into 'ggplot2'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 142, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (142/142), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (96/96), done.
remote: Total 58600 (delta 66), reused 100 (delta 46), pack-reused 58458
Receiving objects: 100% (58600/58600), 484.07 MiB | 3.03 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (42795/42795), done.
```

Note that using the url `git@github...` instead of `https://github...` uses SSH 
if you haven't configured your key yet, this may not work.

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

### Some helpful commands for this cloned repository

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_2x.png" alt="xkcd" width="250" /></div>

(image source [https://xkcd.com/1597](https://xkcd.com/1597/))

---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

### Some helpful commands for this cloned repository


**Always** `pull` from the repository before doing anything with the contents (note that `master` refers to the branch name, which may be different depending on the repo)

```
$ git pull origin master
```

--

Check the `status` of your local files

```
$ git status
```

--

See the `log` of the snapshots and their commit messages

```
$ git log
```

--

Compare the `diff`erences a file you have modified and the last commit

```
$ git diff README.md
```

---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

### Some helpful commands for this cloned repository

Replace a file you modified with the most recent commit using `checkout`

```
$ git checkout README.md
```

--

Find out which `branch` you're on

```
$ git branch
```
--

Change to a different branch

```
$ git checkout color-sub
```

--

Pull to update from `color-sub`

```
$ git pull origin color-sub
```

---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## What can you do with someone else's GitHub repository?

### If you do not have _push rights_ 

--

* You can clone the repository and make changes locally, but you cannot push your changes

--

* You can **_fork_** their repository and develop it independently (be sure to check their license and _always_ give attribution)

--

* You can submit a **_pull request_** to their repository if you want to contribute to the original project

--

* You can contact the owner of the repository and ask them to include you as a 
contributor and give you push rights (it is recommended that you discuss the nature of your collaboration with them first)

---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

## Creating a Repository

Let's create a new Git repository and host it on GitHub using our accounts (for the demo, 
I will create the repo in the [EEOB-BioData](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData) organization
so that everyone will have easy access to it).

<br>

--

But first, let's tell Git who you are (replace the text in quotes with your own name and email)

```
$ git config --global user.name "Ada Lovelace"
$ git config --global user.email "adal@analyticalengine.com"
```

--

Now run the following command to see the changes:

```
git config --list 
```

---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

### Some helpful commands for your new repository

--

Initialize a new Git repository

```
$ git init
```

--

After a file has been added or modified, you can stage the file 

```
$ git add README.md
```

--

Commit the file to your local repository and write a message

```
$ git commit -m "initial commit (README.md)"
```


---

# &#x2665; Git &#x2665;

### Some helpful commands for your new repository

After you have made your commit, the repository is up-to-date locally. Next you need to connect
your local repo to the remote.

--

Add the remote

```
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repo-name.git
```

--

Push your snapshot to the remote

```
$ git push -u origin main
```

---

# Git Exercises

### Your Challenge (not graded)

* Write some notes on Chapter 5 in [Bioinformatics Data Skills](http://vincebuffalo.org/book/) (or anything that you found interesting, confusing, or worth sharing) in 
a text file (you can use Markdown or HTML if you like).

* Add this file to your repository and push the changes to the remote on GitHub

* Post the URL to your repository to the `#reading-discussion` channel on Slack

* If you have any problems just post a message on the `#scripting_help` channel

You can also try the [Git/Markdown Exercise](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/Git-Markdown-Exercise) posted online.
